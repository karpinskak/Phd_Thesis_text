	abstract = "We study by means of an Eulerian--Lagrangian model the statistical properties of velocity and acceleration of a neutrally-buoyant finite-sized particle in a turbulent flow statistically homogeneous and isotropic. The particle equation of motion, besides added mass and steady Stokes drag, keeps into account the unsteady Stokes drag force--known as Basset--Boussinesq history force--and the non-Stokesian drag based on Schiller--Naumann parametrization, together with the finite-size Fax{\'e}n corrections. We focus on the case of flow at low Taylor--Reynolds number, Reλ≃31, for which fully resolved numerical data which can be taken as a reference are available [Homann H., Bec J. Finite-size effects in the dynamics of neutrally buoyant particles in turbulent flow. J Fluid Mech 651 (2010) 81--91]. Remarkably, we show that while drag forces have always minor effects on the acceleration statistics, their role is important on the velocity behavior. We propose also that the scaling relations for the particle velocity variance as a function of its size, which have been first detected in fully resolved simulations, does not originate from inertial-scale properties of the background turbulent flow but it is likely to arise from the non-Stokesian component of the drag produced by the wake behind the particle. Furthermore, by means of comparison with fully resolved simulations, we show that the Fax{\'e}n correction to the added mass has a dominant role in the particle acceleration statistics even for particles whose size attains the integral scale.",

These are the largest simulations performed, to date, aimed at improving our understanding of turbulence small-scale structure. We present some basic statistical results and focus on "extreme" events (whose magnitudes are several tens of thousands the mean value). The structure of these extreme events is quite different from that of moderately large events (of the order of 10 times the mean value). In particular, intense vorticity occurs primarily in the form of tubes for moderately large events whereas it is much more "chunky" for extreme events (though probably overlaid on the traditional vortex tubes). We track the temporal evolution of extreme events and find that they are generally short-lived. Extreme magnitudes of energy dissipation rate and enstrophy occur simultaneously in space and remain nearly colocated during their evolution.},

	abstract = "Abstract Anisotropy of turbulence near the top of the stratocumulus-topped boundary layer (STBL) is studied using large-eddy simulation (LES) and measurements from the POST and DYCOMS-II field campaigns. Focusing on turbulence m below the cloud top, we see remarkable similarity between daytime and nocturnal flight data covering different inversion strengths and free-tropospheric conditions. With λ denoting wavelength and cloud-top height, we find that turbulence at is weakly dominated by horizontal fluctuations, while turbulence at becomes strongly dominated by horizontal fluctuations. Between are scales at which vertical fluctuations dominate. Typical-resolution LES of the STBL (based on POST flight 13 and DYCOMS-II flight 1) captures observed characteristics of below-cloud-top turbulence reasonably well. However, using a fixed vertical grid spacing of 5 m, decreasing the horizontal grid spacing and increasing the subgrid-scale mixing length leads to increased dominance of vertical fluctuations, increased entrainment velocity, and decreased liquid water path. Our analysis supports the notion that entrainment parameterizations (e.g., in climate models) could potentially be improved by accounting more accurately for anisotropic deformation of turbulence in the cloud-top region. While LES has the potential to facilitate improved understanding of anisotropic cloud-top turbulence, sensitivity to grid spacing, grid-box aspect ratio, and subgrid-scale model needs to be addressed.",

As an example, collisions of microscopic water droplets in clouds are a necessary step in the production of macroscopic raindrops. Collisions of dust grains are also conjectured to be important for planet formation in the gas surrounding young stars and to play a role in the dynamics of sand storms. In these processes, collisions are favored by fast turbulent motions. Here we review recent advances in the understanding of collisional aggregation due to turbulence. We discuss the role of fractal clustering of particles and caustic singularities of their velocities. We also discuss limitations of the Smoluchowski equation for modeling such processes. These advances lead to a semiquantitative understanding on the influence of turbulence on collision rates and point to deficiencies in the current understanding of rainfall and planet formation.",

The combined, comprehensive instrument suite reveals a surprisingly large contribution in the predrizzle size range of 40--80 μm (transition droplets, or drizzlets), a range typically not measured and assumed to reside in a condensation-to-collision minimum between cloud droplet and drizzle modes. Besides shedding light on the onset of collision coalescence, drizzlets are essential contributors to optical and chemical properties because of a substantial contribution to the total surface area. When adjusted to match spatial resolution of spaceborne remote sensing, the missing drizzlets bring in situ measurements to closer agreement with satellite observations.",

	abstract = "In this paper, we report on the successful and seamless simulation of turbulence and the evolution of cloud droplets to raindrops over 10 minutes from microscopic viewpoints by using direct numerical simulation. Included processes are condensation--evaporation, collision--coalescence of droplets with hydrodynamic interaction, Reynolds number dependent drag, and turbulent flow within a parcel that is ascending within a self-consistently determined updraft inside a cumulus cloud. We found that the altitude and the updraft velocity of the parcel, the mean supersaturation, and the liquid water content are insensitive to the turbulence intensity, and that when the turbulence intensity increases, the droplet number density swiftly decreases while the spectral width of droplets rapidly increases. This study marks the first time the evolution of the mass density distribution function has been successfully calculated from microscopic computations. The turbulence accelerated to form a second peak in the mass density distribution function, leading to the raindrop formation, and the radius of the largest drop was over 300 μm at the end of the simulation. We also found that cloud droplets modify the turbulence in a way that is unlike the Kolmogorov--Obukhov--Corrsin theory. For example, the temperature and water vapor spectra at low wavenumbers become shallower than in the inertial-convective range, and decrease slower than exponentially in the diffusive range. This spectra modification is explained by nonlinear interactions between turbulent mixing and the evaporation--condensation process associated with large numbers of droplets.",

	abstract = "Abstract A statistical analysis of a series of droplet arrival times measured by the Fast Forward-Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP) during aircraft flights in cumulus clouds was conducted. The main purpose of the analysis was to determine whether droplet concentration fluctuates at small scales on the order of a few centimeters or whether these fluctuations are negligible as compared with the mean concentration. In the analysis, the series of droplet arrival times is regarded as a generalized Poisson random process with time-dependent (or space dependent) parameters. The method developed is based on the representation of droplet concentration in a cloud along the aircraft track as the sum of three components: average droplet concentration in a cloud, large-scale fluctuations of droplet concentrations described by the Fourier series, and a small-scale noncoherent fraction of concentration fluctuation characterized by the energy spectrum and the correlation function. The efficiency of the method to estimate the amplitude and spatial characteristics of small-scale droplet concentration fluctuations and to calculate the profile of large-scale components of droplet concentration along the aircraft track was carefully tested using model-simulated series of droplet arrival times. The method was used to analyze a measurement sample in a cumulus cloud on a 350-m segment. The properties of droplet concentration were calculated both over the whole cloud traverse and within the adiabatic core. The results of the calculations show the existence of pronounced small-scale droplet concentration fluctuations in the case study. The rms of small-scale droplet concentration fluctuations was estimated to be about 31\% of the mean values of droplet concentration both over the whole cloud and in a more homogeneous adiabatic core. The power spectrum shows that fluctuations with spatial scales within the 0.5--5-cm range contain over 80\% of the energy of small-scale fluctuations.",

@article{Knyazikhin2005,
	abstract = "Abstract Most cloud radiation models and conventional data processing techniques assume that the mean number of drops of a given radius is proportional to volume. The analysis of microphysical data on liquid water drop sizes shows that, for sufficiently small volumes, this proportionality breaks down; the number of cloud drops of a given radius is instead proportional to the volume raised to a drop size--dependent nonunit power. The coefficient of proportionality, a generalized drop concentration, is a function of the drop size. For abundant small drops the power is unity as assumed in the conventional approach. However, for rarer large drops, it falls increasingly below unity. This empirical fact leads to drop clustering, with the larger drops exhibiting a greater degree of clustering. The generalized drop concentration shows the mean number of drops per cluster, while the power characterizes the occurrence frequency of clusters. With a fixed total number of drops in a cloud, a decrease in frequency of clusters is accompanied by a corresponding increase in the generalized concentration. This initiates a competing process missed in the conventional models: an increase in the number of drops per cluster enhances the impact of rarer large drops on cloud radiation while a decrease in the frequency suppresses it. Because of the nonlinear relationship between the number of clustered drops and the volume, these two opposite tendencies do not necessarily compensate each other. The data analysis suggests that clustered drops likely have a stronger radiative impact compared to their unclustered counterpart; ignoring it results in underestimation of the contribution from large drops to cloud horizontal optical path.",

This paper shows striking examples of the spatial distribution of large cloud drops using models that simulate the observed power laws. In contrast to currently used models that assume homogeneity and a Poisson distribution of cloud drops, these models illustrate strong drop clustering, especially with larger drops. The degree of clustering is determined by the observed exponents D(r). The strong clustering of large drops arises naturally from the observed power-law statistics. This clustering has vital consequences for rain physics, including how fast rain can form. For radiative transfer theory, clustering of large drops enhances their impact on the cloud optical path. The clustering phenomenon also helps explain why remotely sensed cloud drop size is generally larger than that measured in situ.",

For the type of small-scale structure (clustering) modeled in this study, the most promising analysis approach is to use a combination of the power spectrum and the fishing statistic. Standard deviations and confidence intervals are determined for the power spectrum, the pair correlation function, and a modified fishing statistic.

Here we show, by using the correlation-fluctuation theorem and the Wiener--Khinchin theorem, that all of these measures can be related to the pair-correlation function.

Counting statistics and the Fishing test are applied and compared to the properties of a random spatial distribution, that is, to Poisson statistics. These tests suggest that microscale heterogeneities of the concentration are not significant in adiabatic cores. A conceptual model is then developed to estimate the lifetime that would be required for the observed heterogeneities to generate the observed spectra broadening. The model implies that the lifetime of the heterogeneities should reach unrealistic values to significantly contribute to the observed broadening. The statistical properties of direct numerical simulations of the droplet inertial coupling with turbulence are then compared to the properties of the actual samples. It appears that the properties of the actual samples are closer to the Poisson reference than those of the fields generated by the models. It is concluded that the microscale observations of the droplet spatial distribution in adiabatic cores do not support the hypothesis that inertial coupling is a significant source of spectra broadening.",

They provide evidence that inertial droplet clustering occurs even in weakly turbulent clouds. The measurements were made from the Airborne Cloud Turbulence Observation System suspended from a tethered balloon. For a profile through a stratus cloud with gradually changing droplet Stokes number, droplet clustering, quantified by the pair correlation function, is observed to be positively correlated with the droplet Stokes number. This implies that the droplet collision rate, which is relevant to drizzle formation via droplet coalescence, depends not only on the droplet size distribution, but also on the cloud turbulence. For cumulus clouds, the relation between droplet clustering and Stokes number seems more complicated. Stokes number is determined by measuring droplet size and local energy dissipation rate, the latter requiring high-resolution air velocity measurements not possible on fast-flying aircraft.",

An artificial, weakly turbulent cloud, consisting of droplets of diameter around 14µm, is observed in a laboratory chamber. Droplets on a vertical cross-section through the cloud interior are imaged using laser sheet photography. Images are digitized and numerically processed in order to retrieve droplet positions in a vertical plane. The spatial distribution of droplets in the range of scales, l, from 4 to 80 mm is characterized by: the clustering index CI(l), the volume averaged pair correlation function η(l) and a local density defined on a basis of correlation analysis. The results indicate that, even in weak turbulence in the chamber that is less intense and less intermittent than turbulence observed in clouds, droplets are not spread according to the Poisson distribution. The importance of this deviation from the Poisson distribution is unclear when looking at CI(l) and η(l). The local density indicates that in small scales each droplet has, on average, more neighbours than expected from the average droplet concentration and gives a qualitative and intuitive measure of clustering.

We study the impact of droplet clustering on the growth of settling collector drops by modelling it as an exponentially decaying correlation. Enhancement in collector drop growth is measured by the reduction in time needed for drizzle formation in the last stage. Effect of clustering is characterised by two dimensionless parameters C = δλL and K=(λ0 L) -1, where δλ is the enhancement in the collision rate inside the clusters, L is the cluster size perceived by the settling collector drop and λ0 is the initial collision rate. Increasing C or K reduces the time needed for drizzle formation compared to the unclustered case. We find that for K ≥ 5, C ≤ 2 even a small increase in droplet concentration inside clusters can cause a significant enhancement in the collector drop growth. Further even for low turbulence intensities (low K) significant reduction in the time for drizzle formation is achieved for moderate values of C. These findings are relevant to the debate on the intensity of clustering needed to explain rapid drizzle formation. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",

	abstract = "Abstract Measurements of cloud droplet spectra performed with the Fast-Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe during the Small Cumulus Microphysics Study (1995) are analyzed. Fifty cloud samples with narrow droplet spectra are selected. They are characterized by values of liquid water content slightly below the adiabatic value. Each observed spectrum is then compared to a narrow adiabatic spectrum predicted at the same level with the current theory of condensational growth in an adiabatic cloud cell, initialized with a reference spectrum measured right above the activation level, at cloud base. Broadening is characterized for each observed spectrum by the probability density function of condensational growth expressed as the Lagrangian integral of the ratio of supersaturation to vertical velocity, along the droplet trajectories. In particular it appears that the derived density functions show high probabilities of very low and very large values of condensational growth. The large values are related to a high relative density of big droplets in the measured spectra, higher than predicted by the adiabatic model. The contribution of the instrument to this feature is examined with a model of probe functioning. The simulations suggest that most of those big droplets are instrumental artifacts. The remaining broadening is parameterized by a linear relationship between the mean value and the standard deviation of the density function of condensational growth. This result will be used to examine the respective contributions to spectra broadening of microscale heterogeneities of the droplet concentration, in Part II, and of the mixing processes, in Part III of this series.",

	abstract = "Vapour condensation in cloud cores produces small droplets that are close to one another in size. Droplets are believed to grow to raindrop size by coalescence due to collision1,2. Air turbulence is thought to be the main cause for collisions of similar-sized droplets exceeding radii of a few micrometres, and therefore rain prediction requires a quantitative description of droplet collision in turbulence1,2,3,4,5. Turbulent vortices act as small centrifuges that spin heavy droplets out, creating concentration inhomogeneities6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 and jets of droplets, both of which increase the mean collision rate. Here we derive a formula for the collision rate of small heavy particles in a turbulent flow, using a recently developed formalism for tracing random trajectories15,16. We describe an enhancement of inertial effects by turbulence intermittency and an interplay between turbulence and gravity that determines the collision rate. We present a new mechanism, the {\lq}sling effect{\rq}, for collisions due to jets of droplets that become detached from the air flow. We conclude that air turbulence can substantially accelerate the appearance of large droplets that trigger rain.",

@article{Ayala2008,
	abstract = "There have been relatively few studies of turbulent collision rate of sedimenting droplets in the context of cloud physics, for which both the gravitational settling and inertial effects must be simultaneously considered. In this study, direct numerical simulations (DNS) were used to study the geometric collision rates of cloud droplets. Both Stokes drag law and a nonlinear drag law were considered, but the droplet--droplet local aerodynamic interactions were not included. Typical droplet and turbulence parameters of convective clouds were used to determine the flow dissipation rate ϵ, characteristic Stokes numbers, and the nondimensional terminal velocities. DNS results from a large number of runs covering the ϵ range from 10 to 400 cm2 s− 3 and droplet sizes from 10 to 60 μm in radius are presented. These results show that air turbulence can increase the geometric collision kernel by up to 47\%, relative to geometric collision by differential sedimentation. This is due to both a moderate enhancement of the radial relative velocity between droplets and a moderate level of pair nonuniform concentration due to local droplet clustering. The turbulence enhancements increase with the flow dissipation rate and flow Reynolds number. Comparisons with related DNS studies show that our results confirm and extend the previous findings. The mean settling velocity of droplets in a turbulent flow was also obtained, showing that a maximum increase relative to the terminal velocity occurs for 20 μm cloud droplets. This agrees with a previous theory based on simple vortex flows and confirms the importance of a new nondimensional parameter τp3g2/ν for sedimenting droplets, where τp is the droplet inertial response time, g is the gravitational acceleration and ν is the air kinematic viscosity. Limitations of DNS and future directions are also noted.",

@article{Rosa2016,
	abstract = "The gravitational settling velocity of small heavy particles in a three-dimensional turbulent flow remains a controversial topic. In a homogeneous turbulence of zero mean velocity, both enhanced settling velocity and reduced settling velocity have been reported relative to the still-fluid terminal velocity. Dominant mechanisms for enhanced settling include the preferential sweeping and particle-particle hydrodynamic interactions. The reduced settling could result from loitering (falling particles spend more time in the regions with upward flow), vortex trapping, and drag nonlinearity. Here high-resolution direct numerical simulations (DNS) are used to investigate the settling velocity of non-interacting small heavy particles, for an extended range of flow Taylor microscale Reynolds numbers (up to Rλ=500) with varying particle terminal velocity (relative to the Kolmogorov velocity) and particle inertia, by changing the particle-to-fluid density ratio and energy dissipation rate. For the parameter regimes considered here, the preferential sweeping has a dominant effect leading to an increase of the average settling velocity relative to the terminal velocity; and this increase is mainly governed by particle Froude number (the ratio between the particle inertial response time and the residence time of the particle in a Kolmogorov eddy) and its magnitude depends linearly on the square root of the energy dissipation rate. The reduction of settling due to loitering rarely occurs in a homogeneous turbulence without organized large-scale vortical structures, but is found to emerge only if the particle horizontal motions are blocked (thus removing the preferential sweeping effect), as shown in Good et al. (2014). The DNS results were used to develop a parameterization that relates the settling velocity to the particle inertia (St), Froude number, and Rλ. Finally, sensitivities of the DNS results to the large-scale forcing method and to the drag nonlinearity are also briefly discussed.",

@article{Monchaux2012,
	abstract = "Particle laden flows are of relevant interest in many industrial and natural systems. When the carrier flow is turbulent, a striking feature is the tendency of particles denser than the fluid to inhomogeneously distribute in space, forming clusters and depleted regions. This phenomenon, known as ``preferential concentration'', has now been extensively investigated since the 1960s. The commonly invoked turbophoretic effect, responsible for the centrifugation of heavy particles outside the turbulent vortices, has recently got more complex by other additional mechanisms which have been shown to potentially play an important role in segregating the particles (for instance particles with moderate Stokes number have been shown to preferentially stick to low-acceleration points of the carrier flow). As a matter of fact a complete frame for accurately describing and modeling the particle-flow interaction is not yet available and basic questions, as the existence or not of a typical cluster size or of a typical cluster life-time-scale, still remain to be answered. This requires further quantitative investigations of preferential concentration (both from experiments and numerics) as well as dedicated mathematical tools in order to analyze the dispersed phase, its structuring properties and its dynamics (from individual particle level up to clusters level). This review focuses on the description of the techniques available nowadays to investigate the preferential concentration of inertial particles in turbulent flows. We first briefly recall the historical context of the problem followed by a description of usual experimental and numerical configurations classically employed to investigate this phenomenon. Then we present the main mathematical analysis techniques which have been developed and implemented up to now to diagnose and characterize the clustering properties of dispersed particles. We show the advantages, drawbacks and complementarity of the different existing approaches. To finish, we present physical mechanisms which have already been identified as important and discuss the expected breakthrough from future investigations.",

Particles Stokes number values range from St ≈ 0.2 to 70. Stationary small-scale particle distribution is shown to display a singular --multifractal-- measure, characterized by a set of generalized fractal dimensions with a strong sensitivity on the Stokes number and a possible, small Reynolds number dependency. Velocity increments between two inertial particles depend on the relative weight between smooth events - where particle velocity is approximately the same of the fluid velocity-, and caustic contributions - when two close particles have very different velocities. The latter events lead to a non-differentiable small-scale behaviour for the relative velocity. The relative weight of these two contributions changes at varying the importance of inertia. We show that moments of the velocity difference display a quasi bi-fractal-behavior and that the scaling properties of velocity increments for not too small Stokes number are in good agreement with a recent theoretical prediction made by K.

@article{Bewley2013,
	abstract = "When cloud particles are small enough, they move with the turbulent air in the cloud. On the other hand, as particles become larger their inertia affects their motions, and they move differently than the air. These inertial dynamics impact cloud evolution and ultimately climate prediction, since clouds govern the Earth's energy balances. However, we lack a simple description of the dynamics. Falkovich et al describe theoretically a new dynamical mechanism called the {\lq}sling effect{\rq} by which extreme events in the turbulent air cause idealized inertial cloud particles to break free from the airflow (Falkovich et al 2002 Nature 419 151). The sling effect thereafter causes particle trajectories to cross each other within isolated pockets in the flow, which increases the chance of collisions that forms larger particles. We combined experimental techniques that allow for precise control of a turbulent flow with three-dimensional tracking of multiple particles at unprecedented resolution. In this way, we could observe both the sling effect and crossing trajectories between real particles. We isolated the inertial sling dynamics from those caused by turbulent advection by conditionally averaging the data. We found the dynamics to be universal in terms of a local Stokes number that quantifies the local particle velocity gradients. We measured the probability density of this quantity, which shows that sharp gradients became more frequent as the global Stokes number increased. We observed that sharp compressive gradients in the airflow initiated the sling effect, and that thereafter gradients in the particle flow ran away and steepened in a way that produced singularities in the flow in finite time. During this process both the fluid motions and gravity became unimportant. The results underpin a framework for describing a crucial aspect of inertial particle dynamics and predicting collisions between particles.",

	abstract = {The preferential concentration of poly-dispersed water droplets with a range of Sauter mean diameters between 25 and 95 $\mu$m has been studied experimentally in stationary homogeneous isotropic turbulence with four different intensities, characterized by turbulent Reynolds numbers based on Taylor microscale, of Re$\lambda$ = 107, 145, 185 and 213. The image processing method of recorded scattered light intensity images from droplets is described and its ability to identify droplets is assessed in terms of image quality. The influence of image processing parameters on measured characteristics of droplet clustering is evaluated. The radial distribution function (RDF) and 2D Vorono{\"i} analysis quantified the magnitude of preferential droplet concentration and the results from both methods agreed well. RDF showed that the characteristic length scale of resulting droplet clusters varies between 20 and 30 times the Kolmogorov length scale over all the experimental conditions. It was found that the preferential concentration is more appropriately described by a Stokes number, based on various representative diameters, namely the arithmetic mean diameter, D10, or the diameter, DN60 {\%}, below which 60 {\%} of the total droplet number in the spray is present, or the diameter, DV5 {\%}, which carries 5 {\%} of the total liquid volume in the spray. The magnitude of droplet preferential concentration was maximum when the proposed Stokes number was around unity for all experimental conditions. Little dependence of the magnitude of preferential concentration on turbulent Reynolds numbers was found, in contrast to the recent DNS findings (Tagawa et al. in J Fluid Mech 693:201--215, 2012).},

	abstract = "Particles that are heavy compared to the fluid in which they are embedded (inertial particles) tend to cluster in turbulent flow, with the degree of clustering depending on the particle Stokes number. The phenomenon is relevant to a variety of systems, including atmospheric clouds; in most realistic systems particles have a continuous distribution of sizes and therefore the clustering of {\lq}polydisperse{\rq} particle populations is of special relevance. In this work a theoretical expression for the radial distribution function (RDF) for mono- and bidisperse inertial particles in the low Stokes number limit (Chun et al 2005 J. Fluid Mech. 536 219--51) is compared with the results of a direct numerical simulation of particle-laden turbulence. The results confirm the power-law form of the RDF for monodisperse particles with St ≲ 0.3. The clustering signature occurs at scales ≲10--30 times the Kolmogorov scale, consistent with a dissipation-scale mechanism. The theory correctly predicts the decorrelation scale below which bidisperse particles cease to cluster because of their distinct inertial response. A {\lq}saturation{\rq} effect was observed, however, in which the power-law exponent is limited by the least clustered particle population. An expression is presented with which a polydisperse RDF can be obtained from the mono- and bidisperse RDFs and the particle size distribution. The DNS data clearly show that the effect of polydispersity is to diminish clustering, and place a bound on the level of polydispersity required to approximate a monodisperse system; this result is of relevance to experimental studies and realistic systems.",

	abstract = "Disperse two-phase flows are flows containing two non-miscible phases where one phase is present as a set of discrete elements dispersed in the second one. These discrete elements, or {\lq}particles{\rq}, can be droplets, bubbles or solid particles having different sizes. This situation encompasses a wide range of phenomena, from nano-particles and colloids sensitive to the molecular fluctuations of the carrier fluid to inertia particles transported by the large-scale motions of turbulent flows and, depending on the phenomenon studied, a broad spectrum of approaches have been developed. The aim of the present article is to analyze statistical models of particles in turbulent flows by addressing this issue as the extension of the classical formulations operating at a molecular or meso-molecular level of description. It has a three-fold purpose: (1) to bring out the thread of continuity between models for discrete particles in turbulent flows (above the hydrodynamical level of description) and classical mesoscopic formulations of statistical physics (below the hydrodynamical level); (2) to reveal the specific challenges met by statistical models in turbulence; (3) to establish a methodology for modeling particle dynamics in random media with non-zero space and time correlations. The presentation is therefore centered on organizing the different approaches, establishing links and clarifying physical foundations. The analysis of disperse two-phase flow models is developed by discussing: first, approaches of classical statistical physics; then, by considering models for single-phase turbulent flows; and, finally, by addressing current formulations for discrete particles in turbulent flows. This brings out that particle-based models do not cease to exist above the hydrodynamical level and offer great interest when combined with proper stochastic formulations to account for the lack of equilibrium distributions and scale separation. In the course of this study, general results for dynamical systems influenced by colored or white noises are established which point to the necessity of developing statistical models for particles in random media from a new standpoint that breaks away from descriptions based only on particle kinetic variables. This is needed to obtain well-posed formulations of particle dispersion by non fully-resolved turbulent flows and suggests also to revisit classical ideas of particle--particle interactions in the presence of a turbulent flow which correlates the dynamics of colliding discrete elements.",

It investigated a complicated system of nonlinear equations, in order to find out enough about the properties of the solutions of these equations that insight can be obtained into the various patterns exhibited by the field and that data can be derived concerning the relative frequencies of these patterns in the hope that in this way a basis may be found for the calculation of important values. The difficulties encounter are of a twofold nature: in part they are connected with the complicated geometrical character of the hydrodynamical equations; in part they are dependent upon the presence of nonlinear terms, containing derivatives of the first order of the velocity components, along with derivatives of the second order multiplied by the very small coefficient of viscosity. The latter feature is responsible for a number of important, characteristics of turbulence, among which are prominent those connected with the balance of energy and with the appearance of dissipation layers. These layer an important part in the energy exchange, as they represent the main regions where energy is dissipated.",

The exact solutions describe uniform vortices of elliptical cross-section in inviscid fluid subject to stretching parallel to their axes. These solutions complement the description of vortex collapse found by asymptotic methods. The relevance of these results stems from the prevalence of vortex structures subject to strain in turbulent flows.",

The technique of phase Doppler interferometry (PDI) confers numerous advantages relative to traditional light-scattering techniques for measurement of the cloud drop size distribution, and, in addition, yields drop velocity information. Here, we describe PDI for the purposes of aiding atmospheric scientists in understanding the technique fundamentals, advantages, and limitations in measuring cloud microphysical properties. The performance of the Artium Flight PDI, an instrument specifically designed for airborne cloud measurements, is studied. Drop size distributions, liquid water content, and velocity distributions are compared with those measured by other airborne instruments.",

The theory of PIV is expanded to encompass this situation. Equations are derived for a particle image intensity function that yields image diameter and intensity as a function of distance from the object plane, as well as an equation for a new quantity, termed particle visibility. The effect of changing experimental parameters is discussed. Next, the contribution of out-of-focus particles to the correlation function is addressed. A weighting function that can be used to calculate either velocity measurement bias or the distance from the object plane beyond which particles no longer significantly contribute to the correlation function is derived. A new experimental parameter, the depth of correlation, is then introduced, and its dependence on experimental parameters is discussed.",

@article{Kostinski2005,
	abstract = "After the initial rapid growth by condensation, further growth of a cloud droplet is punctuated by coalescence events. Such a growth process is essentially stochastic. Yet, computational approaches to this problem dominate and transparent quantitative theory remains elusive. The stochastic coalescence problem is revisited and it is shown, via simple back-of-the-envelope results, that regardless of the initial size, the fastest one-in-a-million droplets, required for warm rain initiation, grow about 10 times faster than the average droplet. While approximate, the development presented herein is based on a realistic expression for the rate of coalescence. The results place a lower bound on the relative velocity of neighboring droplets, necessary for warm rain initiation. Such velocity differences may arise from a variety of physical mechanisms. As an example, turbulent shear is considered and it is argued that even in the most pessimistic case of a cloud composed of single-sized droplets, rain can still form in 30 min under realistic conditions. More importantly, this conclusion is reached without having to appeal to giant nuclei or droplet clustering, only occasional ``fast eddies.'' This is so because, combined with the factor of 10 accelerated growth of the one-in-a-million fastest droplets, the traditional turbulent energy cascade provides sufficient microshear at interdroplet scales to initiate warm rain in cumulus clouds within the observed times of about 30 min. The simple arguments presented here are readily generalized for a variety of time scales, drizzle production, and other coagulation processes.",
